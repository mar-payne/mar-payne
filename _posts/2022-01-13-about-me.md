#### An About Me Blog Post

Hello! If you wanna learn more about me, you've come to the right spot. My name is Mariah Payne and I am a current junior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) here in Newport News, Virginia. I use she/her pronouns and I am majoring in History while minoring in Museum Studies and Psychology. **You may be wondering why I am writing this.** Well, it’s because I am currently taking a Digital Humanities course at my school. 

Why did I take this course? So I could satisfy a requirement for my Museum Studies Minor. I had never heard of Digital Humanities until my museum studies professor told our class about it last semester. My personal hope for this course is to learn how to write for social media, since related jobs have become popular over the past few years. If I were to work at a museum or historical site in the future, I would be able to manage a social media account or blog if they needed me to.

That leads me to my current career interests. So far, _I am not sure what I want from the future._ As of **right now** I want to look for jobs directly out of college in New York. Though I am not sure what I want, I am open to learn about and apply for many different jobs in and outside of my current studies. Mostly, I hope to find a niche that will allow me to express my creative side every day. 

This past fall, I volunteered at the [Mariner’s Museum](https://www.marinersmuseum.org/), also here in Newport News. For this current spring semester, I plan on joining an honor society and finding a job on campus. For this coming summer, I will be interning at a historical foundation in my hometown which I am extremely excited about. I will be learning how to speak in front of audiences, how to take care of and manage a historic site, and how to reach out to a local community about history.

I have many personal interests and hobbies. For starters, I love playing music. I have played the clarinet since I was 11 years old. Though I do not play as often as I used to, I love to pick it up now and again in my school’s band. I love listening to music as well, and I am currently using the New Year to challenge myself by listening to an album every day for a year. I am pretty much into any genre (except country) and am always accepting recommendations. 

I also love hanging out with my friends, by either playing board games (particularly [_Betrayal at the House on the Hill_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill)), seeing local artists in concert, or watching old movies. 

Thanks for reading and learning a little bit more about me.
