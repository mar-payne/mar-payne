#### An About Me Blog Post

Hello! My name is Mariah Payne and I am a current junior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) here in Newport News, Virginia. I use she/her pronouns and I am majoring in History while minoring in Museum Studies and Psychology. **You may be wondering why I am writing this.** Well, it’s because I am currently taking a Digital Humanities course at my school. 

Why did I take this course? So that I could satisfy a requirement for my Museum Studies Minor. I had never heard of Digital Humanities until my museum studies professor last semester told our class about it. My personal hope for this course is that it will teach me how to write for social media, since jobs related to this have become popular over the past few years. That, I believe, will also help me manage a social media account for a museum or historic site if they need me to. 

That leads me to my current career interests. So far, _I am not sure what I want from the future._ As of **right now** I want to look for jobs directly out of college in New York. Though I am not sure what I want, I am open to learn about and apply for many different jobs in and outside of my current studies. Mostly, I hope to find a niche that will allow me to express my creative side every day. 

This past fall, I volunteered at the [Mariner’s Museum](https://www.marinersmuseum.org/), also here in Newport News. For this current spring semester, I am planning on joining an honor society and finding a job on campus. As for this coming summer, I will be interning at a historical foundation in my hometown which I am extremely excited about. 

I have many personal interests and hobbies. For starters, I love playing music. I have played the clarinet since I was 11 years old. Though I do not play as often as I used to, I love to pick it up now and again in my school’s band. I love listening to music as well, and I am currently using the New Year to challenge myself by listening to an album every day for the year. I am pretty much into any genre (except top 40 country) and am always accepting recommendations. 

I also love hanging out with my friends, by either playing board games (particularly [_Betrayal at the House on the Hill_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill)), seeing local artists in concert, or watching old movies.
