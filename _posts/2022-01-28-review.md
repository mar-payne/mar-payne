## Summary
Peter van Huijstee and his team created the “Interactive Documentary, Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights” (GED) as an interactive art history project about the late Medieval painting. Art historians and students can click around and explore the provided bookmarks to learn more about each aspect of the painting. 

## Desktop Version
When opening GED, a pop-up shows up on the screen describing the project’s objectives. Though this is a helpful step into understanding the mechanics of GED, it does not provide information on who Bosch is or when this painting was created. Instead, the viewer has to go through each of the bookmarks to understand more, which is an unlikely scenario. Adding more information up-front would fix this issue.

Details of the painting are clear due to the high-quality nature of GED. Users can hover over bookmarks to see the name of the annotation, making the site less overwhelming. As users click between different bookmarks, GED provides a smooth animation while zooming in and out of the painting. However, users have to click the “go back” button provided on the screen rather than the back button on the top of the browser. Changing this would improve user-friendliness. While on GED, users can also scroll around to look at other parts not specifically annotated, look at the painting without bookmarks, or fullscreen the painting.


GED implements sounds throughout the entire project. Calming medieval music plays as the user interacts with the site but can be muted at any time. Each bookmark also plays background noises that relate to that specific part of the painting. For example, users can hear an elephant after clicking on the bookmark with an elephant. Both the music and noises turn down so that users can hear a pausable narration for each annotation. A text version of the narration is available as well for those who are unable to hear at the moment, as shown below for the “Fruits” annotation.

Other features include a highlight tour that users can opt into at any moment. On the tour, users can skip around depending on what they are interested in learning, giving the user control. When revisiting the website, a different pop-up appears with the option to continue the tour where left off. However, when asking if the user wants to start the tour or continue, there is a spelling error that says “of” instead of “or.”


## Mobile Version
GED’s pop up when entering the mobile version of the website includes a warning about possible bandwidth issues. Many of the features are the same as the desktop, but there are a couple of issues. 

First, the text version of the narration covers up most of the painting, making it difficult to look at. However, making the text any smaller will make it hard for users to see. Viewers may just have to read and then click out of the text in order to look at the painting. For example, in the photo below, the “Tree man” text completely covers up the image of the tree man. 

 Second, the back button on the mobile device takes the viewer completely out of GED instead of back to the whole view of the painting. Similar to desktop, the viewer has to click the “go back” button on the screen to zoom out.

As for music, there is none. When looking at the website, the mute button does not appear and I did not hear anything after turning up my volume. 

## Conclusion
GED is a wonderfully made project that aims to teach more about Bosch’s famous painting. Though there are minor issues, mostly concerning the mobile version, none of them make the website unusable. I was able to learn a lot more about a painting I had never heard of in a fun and interactive manner.
