# Semester Reflection 

## Introduction
Prior to taking this course, I had never heard the term “Digital Humanities” (DH) before. I had always been interested in both the humanities, as a history major, and the digital, as someone who took computer science classes in high school. Through the course of the semester, I have learned what DH is and the possibilities for it, even outside of the classroom. 

For the first few weeks of this course, I remember being very confused about the term. When our class wrote our initial definitions for DH, I put that “Digital Humanities is an engaging and educational medium that combines digital era technologies with the humanities. It can be interacted with in many different and fluid ways, making it different from linear humanities or digital projects.” Though I feel that this definition makes sense, I wrote this definition without fully understanding what DH meant. Now, I feel that I do understand what DH is and I can agree with this definition. 


## Review Project
Along the way of defining and understanding DH, I have come across class projects that I loved. For example, our Review Project was one of my favorites. Before we even wrote our own reviews, we prepared by looking at the [_Reviews in Digital Humanities_](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/) website. Through this, I found some amazing projects. Specifically, the [“Indian Community Cookbooks Project,”](https://communitycookbooks.wixsite.com/website/) in which undergraduate students in Pune, India created an open-access cookbook of local Indian cuisines. This project made me realize just how important and impactful DH could be. I was especially inspired by the fact that students studying psychology and marketing could create a DH project, rather than just those studying computer science.

### Readings
There were also quite a few readings I found helpful over the course. A popular one among my classmates and I was the [_Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence_ by Kara Pernice](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-scanning-patterns-eyetracking/). In this reading, I learned about different scanning patterns that readers use when looking at material online. I feel that this gave us the insight needed to write all of our blogs. Even now, I referred to this reading while writing this blog.


Another example was the readings we did to prepare for our grant project. They were extremely helpful in my understanding of grant writing. Specifically, we read a few chapters from Ellen W. Gorsevski’s book _Writing Successful Grant Proposals_. Her writing helped me the most with my grant writing, as she documented exactly what I should put into it. I even shared it with someone I knew who was in the process of writing grants. Since this was my first time writing one, I felt that these readings definitely prepared me well. 


## Google Drive Activities 
I really enjoyed the Google Drive Activities. After many of our discussions, we were able to create Google Docs and write down our initial ideas. It was extremely useful to have this time in class, especially while the ideas were fresh in my mind. 

These activities also helped with procrastination. Since I had ideas written down, I could more easily dive into the project. Sometimes it was frustrating when I did not not have enough time to get my thoughts down. However, I still appreciated the time given. 

Here is an example of one of the class activities. In it, we had to write an opening line for our grant project. I actually ended up using this as my first line, with only a few tweaks added for clarity.

## Writing Improvements
Throughout the course, I feel that I have especially grown as a writer. Before, I had mostly written academic papers which required me to write in a specific format. In this course, however, the blogs and grants twe wrote taught me different styles of writing. I have learned how to write more concisely and with less jargon, to write smaller paragraphs, and to be more enthusiastic with my writing. For the most part, this is different from traditional academic writing. 

I believe that I still have room for improvement, but I am proud of myself for the progress I have made during the course. 


## Conclusion
At the beginning of the semester, I was very excited yet nervous. I thought this class would challenge me in ways that I would really struggle with. Though there were many challenges, I never felt that I was not able to grasp the material. 

This class has taught me a lot. I have learned how to write in different styles, learned new coding languages, and, most importantly, learned what DH is. I hope to take what I learned into my future endeavors, particularly the grant writing. My wish is that more people take DH classes and see the impact it has.
